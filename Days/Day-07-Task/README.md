# All Concept merged using async await

[ðŸ‘ˆ Go Back](./../Readme.md)

**NoteðŸ““:** **_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._**

This Project is a demo project for the [Day-06-Self-Practice](./README.md) a part of [React Internship](../../Readme.md). This Project reveals a uncase of components, hooks (useState, useEffects, useNavigate, createContext, useContext), props. It also reveals an extension of [ðŸ“‚ Day-06-Self-Practice](../Day-06-Self-Practice/README.md) but using `async, await` instead of `promise`. Moreover a concept of caching is introduced, if data is not available in context then only fetching it from`mocked api`.
